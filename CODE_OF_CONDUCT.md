### Reporting Violations

If you witness or experience behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, please report it by:

3. **Discuss directly**: If you feel safe doing so, speak with the person involved

When reporting, please include:
- A description of what happened
- When and where it occurred
- Who was involved
- Any relevant context or evidence (logs, screenshots, etc.)
- Your contact information for follow-up

**All reports will be treated as confidential.** We respect the privacy of reporters and will not disclose their identity without explicit consent.

### Investigation and Response

The Materi community leadership team will:

1. **Acknowledge** your report within 24-48 hours
2. **Investigate** the reported behavior thoroughly and fairly
3. **Communicate** findings and actions taken

- **Escalation**: Report to GitHub's Trust & Safety team or law enforcement if necessary

Community members asked to stop unacceptable behavior are expected to comply immediately. Continued violations after a warning may result in escalation.
